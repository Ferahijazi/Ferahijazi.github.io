I"o<p>For this week, I dedicated my time to watching a lot of tutorials, as I set out my learning goals to learn a little bit of blender and fusion 360. As a design goal, I wanted to do a bit of research on biomimicry, <em>Biomimicry in Architecture</em> by Micheal Pawlyn (2011) p. 38-43</p>

<p>I watched this course on LinkedIn Learning</p>

<p>Some gathered tips:</p>

<p>Ways of Planning Your Design</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Inside Out - like lego, building blocks, you build on top of it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Outside In - like a sculpture, block of clay, carve away final shape from their starting profile.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before starting off with a design, taking measurements of the object you would like to model is crucial. A Digital Caliper can help you with precise measurements.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<em>Minimalism</em></p>

<p>Ummm…to eBay? But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. I’m just glad my fat, ugly mama isn’t alive to see this day. My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book ‘Earth in the Balance’’, and the much more popular ‘‘Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth’, we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.</p>

<p>Your best is an idiot! Fry, you can’t just sit here in the dark listening to classical music. And remember, don’t do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don’t not do it!</p>

<p>You, a bobsleder!? That I’d like to see! I’m Santa Claus! There’s no part of that sentence I didn’t like! Noooooo! I can explain. It’s very valuable.</p>

<p>I’m Santa Claus! Is the Space Pope reptilian!? Who’s brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? I had more, but you go ahead.</p>

<p>It doesn’t look so shiny to me. Kif might! You guys aren’t Santa! You’re not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus? Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by “devil”, I mean Robot Devil. And by “metaphorically”, I mean get your coat.</p>

<p>Check it out, y’all. Everyone who was invited is here. Anyone who laughs is a communist! You’re going to do his laundry? Michelle, I don’t regret this, but I both rue and lament it.</p>

<p>Bender, we’re trying our best. I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe! Oh, you’re a dollar naughtier than most. Hi, I’m a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute.</p>

<p>You, a bobsleder!? That I’d like to see! No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! Good news, everyone! There’s a report on TV with some very bad news! When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought “Why should I?” Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film!</p>

<p>Eeeee! Now say “nuclear wessels”! Why did you bring us here? Yeah, and if you were the pope they’d be all, “Straighten your pope hat.” And “Put on your good vestments.” That’s the ONLY thing about being a slave.</p>
