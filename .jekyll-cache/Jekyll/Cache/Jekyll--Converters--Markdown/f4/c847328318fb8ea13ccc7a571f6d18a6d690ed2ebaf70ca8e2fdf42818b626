I"Á<p><strong>Defining Goals &amp; Setting up a website</strong> First week at Waag and trying to figure out how to work with <em><span style="color:DarkMagenta">github</span>, <span style="color:GoldenRod">jekyll</span>, <span style="color:LightSeaGreen">terminal</span> and getting familirized with some basic coding!</em> The goal was to create a website in order to document my journey at Fablab. I looked into what the fablab academy students are up to and followed their steps!</p>

<p>I started off with opening the fablab academyâ€™s blog posts and seeing what others are up to and what steps they took so far. With the help of the other inter, we managed to look into a few things. First step was choosing a static site generator, as there are way too many options. I chose Jekyll since, according to this youtube video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9g4UkHkzLs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9g4UkHkzLs</a>, it has been around for quiet sometime and has gained a lot of popularity, which thanks to the big community established, it makes it easier to find tutorials and answers quickly. Most importantly, itâ€™s a default static generator that runs github websites and uses ruby.</p>

<p>I had to also familiarized myself with a lot of new terminology since I had no prior experience to jekyll, what ruby or homebrew meant, following this tutorial <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKB9ylw0G4U">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKB9ylw0G4U</a> it helped me gain some basic idea and enabled me to accomplish the first part of the assiment - installing jekyll.</p>

<p>Ummmâ€¦to eBay? But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. Iâ€™m just glad my fat, ugly mama isnâ€™t alive to see this day. My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book â€˜Earth in the Balanceâ€™â€™, and the much more popular â€˜â€˜Harry Potter and the Balance of Earthâ€™, we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.</p>

<p>Your best is an idiot! Fry, you canâ€™t just sit here in the dark listening to classical music. And remember, donâ€™t do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, donâ€™t not do it!</p>

<p>You, a bobsleder!? That Iâ€™d like to see! Iâ€™m Santa Claus! Thereâ€™s no part of that sentence I didnâ€™t like! Noooooo! I can explain. Itâ€™s very valuable.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m Santa Claus! Is the Space Pope reptilian!? Whoâ€™s brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? I had more, but you go ahead.</p>

<p>It doesnâ€™t look so shiny to me. Kif might! You guys arenâ€™t Santa! Youâ€™re not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus? Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by â€œdevilâ€, I mean Robot Devil. And by â€œmetaphoricallyâ€, I mean get your coat.</p>

<p>Check it out, yâ€™all. Everyone who was invited is here. Anyone who laughs is a communist! Youâ€™re going to do his laundry? Michelle, I donâ€™t regret this, but I both rue and lament it.</p>

<p>Bender, weâ€™re trying our best. I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe! Oh, youâ€™re a dollar naughtier than most. Hi, Iâ€™m a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute.</p>

<p>You, a bobsleder!? That Iâ€™d like to see! No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! Good news, everyone! Thereâ€™s a report on TV with some very bad news! When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought â€œWhy should I?â€ Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film!</p>

<p>Eeeee! Now say â€œnuclear wesselsâ€! Why did you bring us here? Yeah, and if you were the pope theyâ€™d be all, â€œStraighten your pope hat.â€ And â€œPut on your good vestments.â€ Thatâ€™s the ONLY thing about being a slave.</p>
