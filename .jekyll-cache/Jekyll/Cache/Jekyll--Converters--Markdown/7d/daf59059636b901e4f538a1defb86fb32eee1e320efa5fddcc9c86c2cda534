<h3 id="safety-instructions">Safety Instructions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>There is an <strong>emergency stop</strong> button which is located at the front of the machine at the bottom(big red &amp; yellow). Once pressed, then stop the vacuum by pressed the button at the upper corner.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>This button is only to be used in cases of real emergency since once pressed, the machine will need to be rebooted.</em></p>

<p><img src="/images/Emergency_stop.jpg" alt="" />
<em>The emergency stop (bottom-right) and vacuum on/off button (top-left)</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>There is an <strong>emergency exit door</strong></li>
  <li>There is a fire extinguisher in the room</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="personal-safety">Personal Safety</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Make sure your hair is tied up. If your hair is long put in in bun.</li>
  <li>Take off accessories</li>
  <li>Be mindful not to wear loose clothing that could get hooked to the machine</li>
  <li>Wear Safety Googles</li>
  <li>Use ear protection</li>
  <li><strong>Stay away from the machine while it’s operating</strong></li>
</ul>

<hr />
<h3 id="fire-safety">Fire Safety</h3>

<ul>
  <li>At the back of the room, there is a vacuum that sucks the chips that the mill creates.</li>
  <li>Metal screws are used to fix the wood to the sacrificial layer.</li>
  <li>The biggest risk of creating a fire is when the milling bit comes into contact with metal. This creates sparks that are then sucked into the vacuum bag.</li>
  <li>To avoid such risks, add drilling holes to your design. The machine will mark the drilling holes on a first toolpath pass.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p><strong>If you hear or see that the bit is hitting the screw, do the following :</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Stop the machine with the emergency stop button at the front of the machine.</li>
  <li>Stop the vacuum with the button at the front of the machine.</li>
  <li>Go to the room with the dust collector bag, loosen the round metal clip with which the plastic bag is attached to the machine.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Inspect the bag.</p>
  </li>
  <li>If a little smoke is coming out:
    <ul>
      <li>Close the bag to reduce the flow of oxygen.</li>
      <li>Walk out of the building and inspect again.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If a lot of smoke is coming out / a fire has started:
    <ul>
      <li>Close the bag to reduce the flow of oxygen and see if that stops it enough to then walk out of the building (possibly through the emergency exit at the back of the milling room).</li>
      <li>If it’s really bad, throw it out of the window (do call down to warn people).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h3 id="other-safety">Other Safety</h3>

<ul>
  <li>While shopBot is running, maximum number of people in the room should be 2 at a time.</li>
  <li>Make sure the bed is clean, no clutter or other items are on it.</li>
  <li><strong>Make sure that nothing is touching the machine from the sides</strong> Clear the space, by organizing the wooden pieces away so there’s spacing.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/images/clear_clutter.jpg" alt="" />
<em>Make sure there is no wooden pieces or other objects touching the machine from the sides</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Make sure the spindle is not going to bump into any screws.</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<h3 id="preparing-the-file-in-vcarve-pro">Preparing the file in <strong>VCarve Pro</strong></h3>

<ul>
  <li>Turn on computer, take out any attached USBs just in case.</li>
  <li>You can edit your design on a software called <strong>v carve pro</strong></li>
  <li>Create a new file</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<p><strong>Setting up the material</strong></p>

<p><img src="/images/jobsetup_vcarve.png" alt="" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Job size (X &amp; Y) : Measure the height and width of your material and assign them to Width(x),Height(y), or use the measurements of your overall design as long as it fits on one board or break it down as you see is suitable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Material (Z) : Set Zero at the bottom if you intend to cut the piece all the way throughthe material, otherwise you can adjust it according to what you intend to do.
<em>Also note that if you are using wax, foam or for 3D mole making, put the Zero near the top!</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Measure the thickness of your material by using a caliper.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>XY Datum position : Use the bottom left corner(See the picture below)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/images/Zero_point_axis.jpg" alt="" />
<em>Check that there are no screws or anything on your material</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>Units: Use mm</li>
  <li>
    <p>Set modeling resolution to high &amp; appearance to pine, just for the sake of visualisation within the software, yet not so important to do so!</p>
  </li>
  <li>Then import your file by going to File &gt; Import &gt; Vectors, choose your file and press ok</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<p><strong>File Operations</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>First, make sure that there are no duplicated vectors. You can do that by going to edit &gt; select all duplicate vectors &gt; delete</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/images/selectallduplicatevectors.png" alt="" /></p>

<hr />

<ul>
  <li>Go to edit objects &gt; Join open vectors (with tolerance)</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/images/file_operationss.jpeg" alt="" /></p>

<hr />

<ul>
  <li>Use transform object to move or rotate object</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/images/transform-align.png" alt="" />
<em>Align to selection and We aligned it to the center</em></p>

<h3 id="changing-milling-bits">Changing Milling Bits</h3>

<p><strong>Types of milling bit</strong>
There are a few things to consider when changing the milling bit. Types of milling bit differ in diameter and type. For instance, there are end mills as well as flat heads &amp; ball heads. For our purpose we used a 5mm,</p>

<p float="left">
<div class="img-with-text">
  <img src="/images/5mm.jpg" width="200" alt="sometext" /> 
  <p>5 mm two flute end mill, it’s the little edges and because it’s flat it’s an end mill</p>
</div>
  <img src="/images/6mm.jpg" width="200" /> 
  <img src="/images/pne_flute_one_edge.jpg" width="200" />
  
</p>

<p><em>5 mm two flute end mill, it’s the little edges and because it’s flat it’s an end mill</em>
<em>6 mm 2 flutes Bull nose means it’s rounded</em>
<em>One flute, one edge</em></p>

<ol>
  <li>5 mm circles for the drilling tool path , the smaller the diameter the longer it takes so 5 is ok, how long your mm is going to be</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/images/Circle_thickness.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Check the depth</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><img src="/images/drilling_holes.jpg" alt="" />
<em>Drilling holes for the screws , 5 * 5</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Toolpaths
<img src="/images/toolpaths.jpg" alt="" /></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Profile tool path</li>
  <li>Pocket tool path - Make a pocket out of the inner circle</li>
  <li>Inner cutting tool paths and outer cutting tool paths</li>
  <li>Engraving will be a pocket so it won’t go all the way through 
<em>You can generate these tools in whatever way you want but best to follow the order suggested</em></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<ol>
  <li>Drilling tool path, don’t cut all the way through 
<img src="/images/drilling_tool_path.jpg" alt="" />
<em>2/3 of the thickness, material might move too much, screw has to hold on to something</em></li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/images/start_depth_drilling.jpg" alt="" />
<em>Start depth which is 0 (top of material)</em></p>

<p><em>5 mm Deep except when you are drilling in a pocket then you start with 5 instead of zero</em></p>

<hr />

<ol>
  <li>Select tool</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/images/5mm-drill.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Fab academy 5 mm end mill</li>
  <li>Spindle speed for wood 18000 and that’s the maximum</li>
  <li>Name your file</li>
  <li>Tool type end mill</li>
  <li>Drilling tool path end mil</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Geometry</em></p>
<ul>
  <li>Diameter is 5</li>
  <li>Cutting parameter</li>
  <li>Pass depth : depth for every path for every vector 2.5 
Half of the diameter(for 5 it’s 2.5) maximum depth of the material removed</li>
  <li>Stepover distance be, it takes more time
<em>For instance 100 means no over lap</em>
<em>3D models, roughing and finishing needs a larger step over</em></li>
  <li>We went with 30% which is not the best results yet not so bad</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/images/30%.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Feedrate is the speed of the machine, going for 50-60 is a good start for wood with 2 flute end mill, when it comes to foam 100-120 mm per sec is a good speed</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Plunge rate is the speed at which the router bit is driven down into the material when starting a cut and will vary depending on the bit used and the material being processed. 20 is good for our piece of wood</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you have a file with different milling bits, save them in different files</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dwell at the bottom - don’t really use it</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use vectors selection order and select the shapes in the order you wish for them to be cut</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/images/shapes_vector.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<hr />

<ol>
  <li>Press Calculate, this is a very important step then press close.</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<ol>
  <li>Preview toolpath</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/images/Preview Toolpaths.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Reset preview - Reset the preview before running.
The toolpath boxes have to be checked to run with Preview Visible Tool Paths. The boxes uncheck when you preview. it will show the order of cutting as well as the depth, for instance to show that the mill will not go all the way through.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<ol>
  <li>Pocket toolpath</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Pocket milling allows the machinist to use an end mill type cutting tool and machine away large amounts of material in a “Roughing” cycle prior to finishing the part. This saves time and efficiently maximizes the amount of material removal. There are different styles of pocket toolpath that include traditional lace or zig-zag (back and forth), concentric or offset In/Out and high speed cutting paths</em></p>

<p>There are three different types of pocket milling</p>

<ul>
  <li>Traditional Pocket Toolpath</li>
  <li>Pocket In/Out Toolpath</li>
  <li>High speed pocket milling toolpath</li>
</ul>

<p><em>The settings we used</em></p>
<ol>
  <li>Fab academy end mill 5 mm from tool list</li>
  <li>Cut depth 6 mm start depth 0</li>
  <li>Clear pocket</li>
  <li>Offset in a spiral fashion concentric</li>
  <li>Cut direction doesn’t matter leave on climb</li>
  <li>Raster angle 90 degrees because it’s less harsher on the machine then press calculate</li>
  <li>Profile pass : Used to clean up the inside edge after machining the pocket. This can be done either before the rastering (First) or after the rastering (Last). last is nicer than in the beginning</li>
  <li>Advanced settings
    <ul>
      <li>Vector Selection order gives you more control over what you do</li>
      <li>Pocket Allowance : The Pocket Allowance allows you to quickly create a toolpath that will machine the pocket either smaller or larger than the defining closed vector. A Pocket Allowance of 0.0 (the default) will create a pocket the exact size of the defining vector.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Close</li>
