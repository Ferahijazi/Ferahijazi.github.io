I"Ú<p>For this week, I dedicated my time to watching a lot of tutorials, as I set out my learning goals to learn a little bit of blender and fusion 360. As a design goal, I wanted to do a bit of research on biomimicry, <em>Biomimicry in Architecture</em> by Micheal Pawlyn (2011) p. 38-43</p>

<p>I watched this course on LinkedIn Learning</p>

<p>Some gathered tips:</p>

<p>Ways of Planning Your Design</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Inside Out - like lego, building blocks, you build on top of it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Outside In - like a sculpture, block of clay, carve away final shape from their starting profile.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Before starting off with a design, taking measurements of the object you would like to model is crucial. A Digital Caliper can help you with precise measurements.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sketch on paper and insert the sketch as a reference for your model.</p>
  </li>

<em>Minimalism</em></p>

<p>Ummmâ€¦to eBay? But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. Iâ€™m just glad my fat, ugly mama isnâ€™t alive to see this day. My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book â€˜Earth in the Balanceâ€™â€™, and the much more popular â€˜â€˜Harry Potter and the Balance of Earthâ€™, we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.</p>

<p>Your best is an idiot! Fry, you canâ€™t just sit here in the dark listening to classical music. And remember, donâ€™t do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, donâ€™t not do it!</p>

<p>You, a bobsleder!? That Iâ€™d like to see! Iâ€™m Santa Claus! Thereâ€™s no part of that sentence I didnâ€™t like! Noooooo! I can explain. Itâ€™s very valuable.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m Santa Claus! Is the Space Pope reptilian!? Whoâ€™s brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? I had more, but you go ahead.</p>

<p>It doesnâ€™t look so shiny to me. Kif might! You guys arenâ€™t Santa! Youâ€™re not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus? Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by â€œdevilâ€, I mean Robot Devil. And by â€œmetaphoricallyâ€, I mean get your coat.</p>

<p>Check it out, yâ€™all. Everyone who was invited is here. Anyone who laughs is a communist! Youâ€™re going to do his laundry? Michelle, I donâ€™t regret this, but I both rue and lament it.</p>

<p>Bender, weâ€™re trying our best. I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe! Oh, youâ€™re a dollar naughtier than most. Hi, Iâ€™m a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute.</p>

<p>You, a bobsleder!? That Iâ€™d like to see! No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! Good news, everyone! Thereâ€™s a report on TV with some very bad news! When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought â€œWhy should I?â€ Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film!</p>

<p>Eeeee! Now say â€œnuclear wesselsâ€! Why did you bring us here? Yeah, and if you were the pope theyâ€™d be all, â€œStraighten your pope hat.â€ And â€œPut on your good vestments.â€ Thatâ€™s the ONLY thing about being a slave.</p>
