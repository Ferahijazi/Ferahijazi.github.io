I"C<p><strong>Defining Goals &amp; Setting up a website</strong> First week at Waag and trying to figure out how to work with <em><span style="color:DarkMagenta">github</span>, <span style="color:GoldenRod">jekyll</span>, <span style="color:LightSeaGreen">terminal</span> and getting familirized with some basic coding!</em> The goal was to create a website in order to document my journey at Fablab. I looked into what the fablab academy students are up to and followed their steps!</p>

<p>I started off with opening the fablab academy’s blog posts and seeing what others are up to and what steps they took so far. With the help of the other inter, we managed to look into a few things. First step was choosing a static site generator, as there are way too many options. I chose Jekyll since, according to this youtube video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9g4UkHkzLs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9g4UkHkzLs</a>, it has been around for quiet sometime and has gained a lot of popularity, which thanks to the big community established, it makes it easier to find tutorials and answers quickly. Most importantly, it’s a default static generator that runs github websites and uses ruby.</p>

<p>I had to also familiarized myself with a lot of new terminology since I had no prior experience to jekyll, what ruby or homebrew meant, following this tutorial <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKB9ylw0G4U">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKB9ylw0G4U</a> it helped me gain some basic idea and enabled me to accomplish the first part of the assiment - installing jekyll.</p>

  <li>Make sure your Macbook is up to date, M1, macOS Monterey or higher</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Side note: When updating, sometimes it takes too long when its 1 minute remaining, if it is the case, make sure that no external devices are connected. i.e. hard drive or a USB device. Also, make sure you have enough space on your computer. other than that just be patient and it will work!</li>
</ul>

  <li>
    <p>On the top, press Go — Utilities — Open terminal.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Right click on the icon of terminal and press options — keep in dock since you will be using it a lot.</p>

<p>Ummm…to eBay? But I know you in the future. I cleaned your poop. I’m just glad my fat, ugly mama isn’t alive to see this day. My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book ‘Earth in the Balance’’, and the much more popular ‘‘Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth’, we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.</p>

<p>Your best is an idiot! Fry, you can’t just sit here in the dark listening to classical music. And remember, don’t do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don’t not do it!</p>

<p>You, a bobsleder!? That I’d like to see! I’m Santa Claus! There’s no part of that sentence I didn’t like! Noooooo! I can explain. It’s very valuable.</p>

<p>I’m Santa Claus! Is the Space Pope reptilian!? Who’s brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? I had more, but you go ahead.</p>

<p>It doesn’t look so shiny to me. Kif might! You guys aren’t Santa! You’re not even robots. How dare you lie in front of Jesus? Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by “devil”, I mean Robot Devil. And by “metaphorically”, I mean get your coat.</p>

<p>Check it out, y’all. Everyone who was invited is here. Anyone who laughs is a communist! You’re going to do his laundry? Michelle, I don’t regret this, but I both rue and lament it.</p>

<p>Bender, we’re trying our best. I daresay that Fry has discovered the smelliest object in the known universe! Oh, you’re a dollar naughtier than most. Hi, I’m a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute.</p>

<p>You, a bobsleder!? That I’d like to see! No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires! Good news, everyone! There’s a report on TV with some very bad news! When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought “Why should I?” Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film!</p>

<p>Eeeee! Now say “nuclear wessels”! Why did you bring us here? Yeah, and if you were the pope they’d be all, “Straighten your pope hat.” And “Put on your good vestments.” That’s the ONLY thing about being a slave.</p>
