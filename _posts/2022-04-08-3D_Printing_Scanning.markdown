We scanned our faces for fun! We used a device called Sense, you have to hold very still while being scanned.

* Once your face is scanned, you can make adjustments such as erase and trim and then press Solidify

 * Import the file into PrusaSlicer on your laptop 

 * Printer settings/configuration assistant, we chose  Prusa i3 MK3S & MK3S+ (0.4 mm nozzle) and Other vendors, choose Creality FFF & Ultimaker FFF
 
 * You can make necessary adjustments before slicing such as scaling and resizing, depending on what you're printing, you might need to paint on supports using the brush tool

* Once your file is ready, save as obj and put it on the stick
* Insert into the 3d printer & switch on from behind
